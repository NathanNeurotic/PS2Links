# Manual Testing Plan for Link List and Favorites Fixes

## Prerequisites
- Clear browser cache and local storage for the site before starting to ensure a clean state.
- Open the browser's developer console to monitor logs.

## Test Cases

### Issue 1: Missing Link Lists in Categories
1.  **Initial Page Load (No Local Storage Data):**
    *   **Expected:** All categories are displayed with their respective link lists. Categories are collapsed by default. Links are visible when a category is expanded.
    *   **Verify:** Check console for any errors during `fetchLinks` or `generateHTML`. Confirm categories appear and links are present when expanded.
2.  **Initial Page Load (With `expandedCategories` in Local Storage):**
    *   **Action:** Manually set `localStorage.setItem('expandedCategories', JSON.stringify(['Online Communities:']));` (or any other category name) and reload.
    *   **Expected:** The specified categories are expanded by default, others are collapsed. All link lists are correctly rendered.
    *   **Verify:** Check console logs.
3.  **Search Functionality:**
    *   **Action:** Type a search query that matches links in multiple categories.
    *   **Expected:** Only sections with matching links are shown, and they are expanded. Non-matching items are hidden.
    *   **Action:** Clear the search query.
    *   **Expected:** All categories return to their previous collapsed/expanded states, and all link lists are correctly rendered (respecting their collapsed state).
    *   **Verify:** Console logs during search and clearing.

### Issue 2: Favorites Section Not Hiding When Empty
1.  **Adding First Favorite:**
    *   **Action:** Add a link to favorites.
    *   **Expected:** "Favorites" section appears and displays the favorited link. The star icon updates.
    *   **Verify:** Console logs from `toggleFavorite` and `ensureFavoritesSection`.
2.  **Adding Multiple Favorites:**
    *   **Action:** Add a few more links to favorites.
    *   **Expected:** "Favorites" section updates with all favorited links.
3.  **Removing a Favorite (Not the Last One):**
    *   **Action:** Remove one favorite when multiple exist.
    *   **Expected:** The link is removed from the "Favorites" section. The section itself remains visible. The star icon updates.
    *   **Verify:** Console logs from `toggleFavorite`.
4.  **Removing the Last Favorite:**
    *   **Action:** Remove the last remaining favorite.
    *   **Expected:** The link is removed, and the entire "Favorites" section disappears from the page. Star icon updates.
    *   **Verify:** Console logs from `toggleFavorite` and `removeFavoritesSectionIfEmpty` (check for "Removing favorites section" and `favorites.length` being 0).
5.  **Favorites Persistence (Page Reload):**
    *   **Action:** Add a favorite. Reload the page.
    *   **Expected:** "Favorites" section appears with the favorited item.
    *   **Action:** Remove the favorite. Reload the page.
    *   **Expected:** "Favorites" section does not appear.
6.  **Toggling a Single Item Repeatedly:**
    *   **Action:** Add a favorite. Remove it. Add it again. Remove it again.
    *   **Expected:** Favorites section appears and disappears correctly each time. `favorites.length` should be 0 when the section is gone.

### General Functionality / Regression Testing
1.  **View Toggle (List/Thumbnail):**
    *   **Action:** Switch between List and Thumbnail views (global and per-category if applicable).
    *   **Expected:** Links display correctly in both views. Favorites section also respects the view.
    *   **Verify:** No console errors. Visual check.
2.  **Theme Toggle (Dark/Light):**
    *   **Action:** Switch between Dark and Light themes.
    *   **Expected:** All elements, including link lists and the favorites section, adapt to the theme correctly.
    *   **Verify:** No console errors. Visual check.
3.  **Collapsible Category Headers:**
    *   **Action:** Click on category headers to expand/collapse them.
    *   **Expected:** Link lists correctly show/hide. State is saved to `localStorage` and restored on reload.
    *   **Verify:** Console logs from `initializeCollapsibles`.

## Logging Review
- Throughout all tests, monitor the browser console for:
    - Errors or warnings.
    - Output from the `console.log` statements added during debugging (they can be removed after successful testing). Specifically, check `favorites.length` and section removal messages during favorites testing.
